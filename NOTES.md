# Measurement log

Warts and all. Every number that ends up in a paper has to be traceable to an entry here, and
every retraction stays visible.

## 2026-09-11: what this project inherits, and its provenance

Nothing below was measured today. It is carried over from `~/projects/dextrack_vega`
(2026-05-24 → 2026-05-30) and is restated here so the paper's claims have one source. Each
line names where it can be re-run.

**The f5d6 opposition floor.** Full-range search over the three thumb joints gives a minimum
thumb-tip-to-finger-mean gap of 3.1 cm with the thumb at its opposition limit (`th_j0 = 1.6`).
Spheres at 3, 4, 5, 6 cm pinched at that limit with fingers closed all fell (~106 cm). Ruled
out first, in this order: collision-mesh coarseness (11 finger collision geoms, all enabled,
contacts generated), then finger stiffness (identical 32.2 cm drop across HAND_KP 8/40/120/300
— the object never contacted at any stiffness, which is what said the cause was kinematic).
Palm-up cradle and enclosed-cage holds fail the same way (drops 15–89 cm).

*Caveat to carry into the paper:* this is measured on the MJX/MuJoCo model built from
`vega_1u_f5d6-obj.urdf` with decimated `.obj` collision meshes and `.glb` visuals stripped.
The mesh audit above is the reason to believe it, but it is a sim claim about a hand, and the
physical f5d6 has not been tested here. Do not write it as a fact about the hardware.

**Two hands restore what one lost.** Bimanual squeeze-lift of a 0.05 kg box: +21.3 cm in
open-loop physics (zero-residual replay, real dynamics). At 0.12 kg the grip slips and the box
reaches ~6 cm. Cooperative tangential reorient: +37° yaw under a BC-trained policy, verified by
`render_gif.py --ckpt` which prints the physical net displacement. This 0.05/0.12 bracket is
the pre-registered validation target for the ε instrument (PLAN.md M1).

**Known distortion in these numbers.** The BC-trained lift policy reaches +5 cm against the
reference's +21 cm, and PPO plateaus at +4 cm across three runs with different residual clips
(0.30, 0.12) and different replay semantics (qpos vs recorded ctrl). Three materially different
setups converging on +4 cm is why it was called a policy local optimum rather than a bug. It
remains the weakest inherited claim: "the tracker is not the bottleneck" is supported by the
push task learning cleanly on MJX (object error 5.4 → 2.9 cm/step over 20 M steps, stable), not
by the lift.

**Arm reachability, which constrains M4.** The Vega 7-DoF arm cannot achieve arbitrary hand
orientations at a workspace point — 90° reorientations fail (position error up to 1.2 m), ~30°
are reachable. From the one feasible vertical-pole wrap pose at (0.55, −0.15, 0.84) there is
zero lift headroom: a 2 cm lift at fixed orientation is unreachable (error 12 cm). The lift DoF
on this humanoid is the torso prismatic, currently an unactuated posture joint that sags under
load. Any re-allocated contact set has to live inside this set, not just inside the joint limits.

**Throughput.** MJX + brax PPO on an A10G via Modal: ~104 k env-steps/s with `lax.scan`
rollouts (~7 k/s with naive per-step dispatch — always scan), ~70 s compile, 100 M steps ≈
16 min ≈ $0.30. The primitive-collision scene required to get there has different contact
physics from the mesh scene (point-ish fingertip contact), so MJX-trained policies and
mesh-scene policies are not comparable and parity holds only within a mode. **This matters for
ε**: the instrument is computed from contact states, so it inherits the collision mode. M1 must
compute ε in both modes on the same grasp and report the disagreement before anything is built
on it. Not yet done.

## Open, before any number is produced

- ε has not been implemented. The 0.05/0.12 bracket is a target, not a result.
- No human grasp data on disk. GRAB/ARCTIC/MANO all require registration (M0).
- Three of the four comparison hands have never been loaded into this scene.
- No hardware. `so101-bench` is a leader-follower pair, not two followers.
